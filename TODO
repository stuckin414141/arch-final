make test cases that 1] don't use closures 2] test records

we are for now forbidding recursive types (will implement after closures)

re-structure pipeline to better support debugging multiple analyses/re-writes
- optimally you will have a single compilation pipeline
- turning on debug mode dumps debug info to other files

apparently declarations made in the condition of an if and/or while
statement and/or expression are available in the body. Unify the rest of the system

add support for records/structs to the MIR (no nested indexing though)
- also add declare expressions to receive arguments

add separate closure-rewrites to the AST


implement polymorphic types/typechecking
implement type-inference
add arrays/pointers???????
