implementing lowering to the typed MIR
- we will have to make malloc() available as part of the external call
- we will need architecture-specific information
    - size of types
    - we need to make external calls to malloc
- we will need to add code to make variables afterwards
verify that lowering closures works alright in MIR/write lowring of STLC
implement polymorphic types/typechecking
implement type-inference
add arrays/pointers???????
